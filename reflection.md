- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
My programming felt more organised where i was able to think about each part of the program separetly by bundling the related methods into classes. i was able to realise and differentiate between what needs to be private vs public. it might have felt abit restrictive at first but i quickly realised that it actually made my code easier to debug. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I had a controlled access to data which worked for me. Using private attributes and public getters,etc made the program easier while forced me to design classes carefully and think about their roles. Nothing major went wrong however i realised that i relied more on getters and setters compared to previouse topics. I would suggest whoever  will take this class to really understand the role and importance of encapsulation and thinking about what should be private vs public, this will make your code much easier.

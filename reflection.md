- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
it was easy to use and allowed me to bundle data together. it helped me understand what needs to stay private vs what needs to be public. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
there was a good controll of access and maintainbility. nothing specifically that didnt work, except maybe a bit overuse of getters then previouse classes but nothing in particular went wrong. an advise would to focus and understand why we use encapsulation and how to use or expose only what is necessary.
